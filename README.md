# treehouse
A static page coded from a PSD file using only HTML, CSS, and a bit of ES5 JavaScript.

## Philosophy
My idea for this challenge was to completely abandon build tools, preprocessors, frameworks etc. and try to code just raw HTML, CSS and JS. CSS uses the BEM approach, with blocks (and sometimes bigger elements) split into separate files. This approach necessitates a lot of requests on page load, so for actual production deployment one should bundle the files together e.g. with Sass.
